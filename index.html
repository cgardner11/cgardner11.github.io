	<p><img id="border" src="images/background.jpg" alt="Cathy"><strong> My Name is Cathy Lambiase</strong> ~ I'm a student, a parent, and a professional graphic designer with a small local design studio. I'm married with two kids in college, love animals-both big and small, the beauty of nature, yoga...and thinking outside the box. I believe we are forever growing and redefining ourselves, and always looking to learn something new, something fun, something that sparks our mind and our spirit...it what makes us unique. On this path to learning, I feel it's important as well that one should also practice kindess, compassion, integrity, and honesty every day, and to always make room in your life for joy and a really good laugh with friends!</p>

	<p><strong>Why Am I Taking This Class?</strong> ~ In my business, I have primarily focused on print advertising and design i.e brochures, packaging, corporate ID etc. I've long appreciated the web and where it has gone design-wise. So...finally, I'm on this journey of attaining a Web Designer Certificate at Saddleback, to enhance my knowledge in the diverse areas that web design offers me professionally, and will enhance my capabilities, that I in turn, can offer to my clients. Technology is ever changing, growing and emerging, and I find it essential to gaining the knowledge to succeed in this area, and to put it into practice.</p>

	<h2>Resources</h2>
	<ul class="a">
		<li><a href="https://www.pexels.com" target="_blank">PEXELS</a> ~ Pexels is a nifty source for some of the best free stock photos around. Come on, a website is more dynamic and interesting when images are used purposely, because we are after all...very visually stimulated. So finding free valuable resources for high-quality, stock images comes in quite handy for a web developer, and it helps keep the costs of creating the site down, which will make everybody a happy camper.</li>
		
		<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3SCHOOLS</a> ~ Sometimes we just get stuck on how to accomplish a certain action when writing code. I found w3Schools an extremely helpful site that gives you definitions for HTML and CSS, it allows you a real-time, online, on-the-spot practice view using given code examples that will just make your life easier.</li>
		
		<li><a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">STACK OVERFLOW</a> ~ Stack Overflow is an online community type blog where millions of programmers congregate to help each other with questions and answers. This site is chalked full of free tips shared by other developers, with fun tricks, and advice on sticky issues when writing code.</li>  
		
		<li><a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/" target="_blank">CoDrops</a> ~ Codrops is a design and development blog with articles and tutorials about the latest web tips and trends. There's a valuable "Tutorial" section for how-to's on web development techniques, a fun "Playground" for plug-ins and helpful articles, a "Blueprints" section that has sample website concepts and layouts, and an extensive CSS reference section.</li>
